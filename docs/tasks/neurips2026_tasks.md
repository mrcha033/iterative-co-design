# NeurIPS 2026 Submission Prep Tasks

## Documentation
- [ ] Translate all mixed Korean/English documentation to full English for consistency and international readability.
- [ ] Review translated documentation for technical accuracy and clarity.

## Experimental Scope
- [ ] Extend evaluations to include larger-scale models beyond BERT-base and Mamba-130M (e.g., BERT-large, Mamba-1B) to strengthen empirical claims.
- [ ] Update benchmarking scripts and resource planning to accommodate larger model training and inference runs.
- [ ] Document any computational constraints or resource requirements encountered when scaling experiments.

## Citation Management
- [ ] Replace the placeholder reference `arXiv: xxxx.xxxxx` with the finalized citation information once available.
- [ ] Verify that all in-text citations and bibliography entries conform to NeurIPS 2026 formatting guidelines.

## Additional Obstacles
- [ ] Confirm compliance with NeurIPS 2026 submission policies (e.g., anonymity, reproducibility checklist, ethics statement).
- [ ] Prepare contingency plans for potential compute or dataset access limitations ahead of submission deadlines.
